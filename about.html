            The premise for this website came to me after another one of those "What's for tea" conversations with the SO.
            So, in my moment of inspiration, a website began to be built in my mind! I definitely had higher aspirations for this at first (which included something I'm fairly sure would involve Javascript), before I admitted to myself: maybe I should learn to walk before I try out for the London Marathon, y'know?
            <br>
            <br>
            Hopefully I can use this website as a tool to streamline the tea time decision making process. If not... Looks like I'll have to learn Javascript!
